## General ATP Statistics
### Q1. Which countries produce the most ATP players?
```
WITH all_players AS (
    SELECT winner_ioc AS player_country, winner_id AS player_id
    FROM atp_matches_2024
    UNION
    SELECT loser_ioc AS player_country, loser_id AS player_id
    FROM atp_matches_2024
),
unique_players AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT player_id, player_country
    FROM all_players
)
SELECT player_country, COUNT(player_id) AS num_players
FROM unique_players
GROUP BY player_country
ORDER BY num_players DESC
LIMIT  3;
```

| player_country | num_players |
|---------------|------------|
| USA           | 35         |
| FRA           | 32         |
| AUS           | 19         |

### Q2.	What is the ratio of left handed to right handed players at the ATP tour level? 
```
WITH dominant_hand_stats as
(SELECT winner_id as player_id, winner_name as player_name, winner_hand as player_hand
FROM atp_matches_2024
 UNION ALL
 SELECT loser_id as player_id, loser_name as player_name, loser_hand as player_hand 
 FROM atp_matches_2024)
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN player_hand = 'L' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS left_handed_players,
    SUM(CASE WHEN player_hand = 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS right_handed_players,
    ROUND(1.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN player_hand = 'L' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / 
              SUM(CASE WHEN player_hand = 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2) AS left_to_right_ratio
FROM dominant_hand_stats;

```
| left_handed_players | right_handed_Players | left_to_right_ratio |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 832                 | 5284                 | 0.16                 |

Left to right ratio - 0.16:1 = 4:25

### Q3.	Which tournaments saw the most upsets in 2024?
Upsets defined as unseeded players beating players seeded 10 or lower.
```
 SELECT tourney_name, sum(case when winner_seed is null and cast(loser_seed as unsigned) <= 10 then 1
          else 0
         end) as tennis_upsets
FROM atp_matches_2024
GROUP BY tourney_name
ORDER BY tennis_upsets DESC
LIMIT 5 ;
```
| tourney_name      | tennis_upsets |
|------------------|--------------|
| Canada Masters  | 9            |
| Winston-Salem   | 8            |
| Tokyo           | 8            |
| Marrakech       | 8            |
| Auckland        | 8            |

### Q4. What was the average match duration on different surfaces from all ATP tournaments? What does it indicate?
The analysis includes averages from all ATP 250, ATP 500 and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments.
```
SELECT round(avg(minutes), 2) as match_duration, surface
FROM atp_matches_2024
WHERE tourney_level = 'M' or tourney_level = 'A'
GROUP BY surface
ORDER BY 1 desc;
```
| match_duration | surface |
|---------------|---------|
| 112.98       | Clay    |
| 105.67       | Hard    |
| 102.22       | Grass   |

This indicates that clay surface which is a slow surface leads to longer rallies and increased match duration. Grass court on the other hand is a fast court with the ball staying low and rallies being short. This leads to the shortest average match duration. 

## Standout Player Performances
### Q5. Who won the most tournaments in 2024?
```
SELECT winner_name, count(winner_name) as tournaments_won
FROM atp_matches_2024
WHERE round = "F"
GROUP BY winner_name
ORDER BY 2 desc
LIMIT 1;
```
| winner_name   | tournaments_won |
|--------------|----------------|
| Jannik Sinner | 8              |

### Q6. Which players had the highest win rates on different surfaces (hard, clay, grass)?
```
select player_id, player_name,
       matches_played, 
	   matches_won, surface,
	   (matches_won * 100/ matches_played) as win_rate
from (select player_id, winner_name as player_name,
             count(*) as matches_played, surface,
	         sum(case when player_id = winner_id then 1 else 0
	         end) as matches_won
	  from (select winner_id as player_id, winner_id, loser_id, winner_name, surface from atp_matches_2024
	        union all select loser_id as player_id, winner_id, loser_id, loser_name, surface from atp_matches_2024) as all_matches
	  group by player_id, surface
) as player_stats
where matches_played >= 10 -- A minimum value set for reliability of players performance
order by win_rate desc, surface desc
limit 3;
```
| player_id | player_name       | matches_played | matches_won | surface | win_rate |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------|---------|----------|
| 206173    | Jannik Sinner    | 57            | 54         | Hard    | 94       |
| 126610    | Matteo Berrettini | 16            | 15         | Clay    | 93       |
| 206173    | Jannik Sinner    | 10            | 9          | Grass   | 90       |

### Q7.	Rank top 10 players by highest average number of aces per set in 2024. How did that impact the match outcome?
